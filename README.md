Files of our Idea for the Web3 Hackathon by Toyota

Our files includes the Presentation file, the Token Contract source file, and our Web System using our own company's Framework.

To setup the WebSystem, you need to create a virtual host opening the `htdocs/index.php` to properly open the web system.

Thank you!
